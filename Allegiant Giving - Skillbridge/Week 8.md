## Overview - Data Science Tools

### Categories
- Data Management
	- Collecting, persisting, and retrieving data securely, efficiently and cost effectively
	- Data is collected from many sources
- Data Integration and Transformation
	- Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)
	- Extract the data and save it in a central repository
	- Transforming the values, structure and format of the data
	- Transformed data is loaded back to a storage area
- Model Building
	- Train the data and analyze patterns using suitable machine learning algorithms
- Model Deployment
	- Integrating a model into a production environment
	- Uses APIs to enable data-based decisions
- Model Monitoring and Assessment
	- Tracks deployed models
	- Checks for accuracy, fairness, and robustness monitoring

### Requirements of Categories
- Execution Environments
	- Libraries for code compiling and system resources to execute and verify code
	- Cloud-based execution environments aren't tied to specific hardware or software
- Data Asset Management
	- Platform for organizing and managing the data
	- Replication, backup, and access right management
- Code Asset Management
	- Unified view where you manage an inventory of assets
	- Developers use versioning to track and manage changes to a software project's code
	- Collaboration allows diverse people to share and update the same project together
- Development Environments
	- Integrated development environments (IDEs) provide a workspace and tolls to work on source code.
	- IDEs like IBM Watson Studio provide testing and simulation tools to emulate the real world so you can see how your code will behave after it is deployed.

### Open Source Data Management Tools
- MongoDB
- CouchDB
- Cassandra
- Hadoop File System

### Code Asset Management
- Tools for code asset management, also known as version management or version control:
	- Git
	- GitHub
	- GitLab
	- BitBucket

### Data Asset Management
- Tools for data asset management, also known as data governance or data lineage:
	- Apache Atlas
	- Egeria
	- Kylo

## Week 2 Summary
- You should select a language to learn depending on your needs, the problems you are trying to solve, and whom you are solving them for.
- The popular languages are Python, R, SQL, Scala, Java, C++, and Julia.
- For data science, you can use Python's scientific computing libraries like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
- Python can also be used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).
- Python is open source, and R is free software.
- R languageâ€™s array-oriented syntax makes it easier to translate from math to code for learners with no or minimal programming background.
- SQL is different from other software development languages because it is a non-procedural language.
- SQL was designed for managing data in relational databases.
- If you learn SQL and use it with one database, you can apply your SQL knowledge with many other databases easily.
- Data science tools built with Java include Weka, Java-ML, Apache MLlib, and Deeplearning4.
- For data science, popular program built with Scala is Apache Spark which includes Shark, MLlib, GraphX, and Spark Streaming.
- Programs built for Data Science with JavaScript include TensorFlow.js and R-js.
- One great application of Julia for Data Science is JuliaDB.
