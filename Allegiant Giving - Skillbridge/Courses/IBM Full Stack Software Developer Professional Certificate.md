# Introduction to Cloud Computing

- Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing resources over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis; resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned among multiple users and scale up and down in response to users’ needs.
- The origins of cloud computing can be traced back to the mainframes of the 1950s, with virtualization technologies and hypervisors serving as catalysts for the emergence of modern-day cloud computing.
- Organizations must consider their business needs, investment viability, and risk capacity to create a cloud adoption strategy that delivers desired benefits without causing business disruptions and security, compliance, or performance issues.
- Cloud adoption is growing faster than predicted. Driving this technological wave are cloud service providers with a host of services ranging from Infrastructure, Platform, and Software services. Some major Cloud providers of our time include AWS, Alibaba Cloud, Google, IBM, and Microsoft Azure.
## Business Case for Cloud Computing

- The adoption of cloud technologies enables enterprises, big and small, to be agile, innovative, and competitive and to create differentiated customer experiences. Organizations are asking not whether they should move to the cloud but rather what strategy they should adopt to move to the cloud.

# Service Models

- Examples - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS)
## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
is a form of cloud computing that delivers fundamental:
- compute
- network
- storage
to consumers on-demand, over the internet, on a pay-as-you-go basis.

The cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components traditionally present in an on-premises data center as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer.

Offers customers the ability to track and monitor the performance and usage of their cloud services and manage disaster recovery.

Object storage is the most common mode of storage in the cloud, given that it is highly distributed and resilient.

# Deployment Models

- Deployment models indicate where the infrastructure resides, who owns and manages it, and how cloud resources and services are made available to users. There are four main deployment models available on the cloud—public, private, hybrid, and community.
- In the public cloud model, the service provider owns, manages, provisions, and maintains the physical infrastructure such as data centers, servers, networking equipment, and storage, with users accessing virtualized computing, networking and storage resources as services.
- In the private cloud model, the provider provisions the cloud infrastructure for exclusive use by a single organization. The private cloud infrastructure can be internal to the organization and run or on-premises. Or it can be on a public cloud, as in the case of Virtual Private Clouds (VPC), and be owned, managed, and operated by the cloud provider.
- In the hybrid cloud model, an organization’s on-premise private cloud and a third-party, public cloud are connected as a single, flexible infrastructure that leverages the features and benefits of both Public and Private clouds.
- In the community cloud model, the provider provisions the cloud infrastructure for use by a community of organizations with shared concerns. One or more of the organizations in the community, a third-party provider, or both are responsible for the ownership, management, and operation of this infrastructure.
# Community Cloud

A community cloud is defined by NIST SP 800-145 as:

“Cloud infrastructure [that] is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.”

## **Why community cloud?**

Community cloud approach is used by organizations for the following reasons:

- The community cloud members work under the same set of security controls.
- The approach provides the members the same attributes like citizenship and authorization controls while giving limited physical and/or logical access to resources.
- It also supports data localization and some data sovereignty requirements based on the location of the community cloud’s data centers. 
- The approach defines a perimeter security model encompassing the community cloud. 
## **Implementation of software-defined community cloud** 

To establish a security perimeter, most legacy community clouds depend on physical separation from other clouds. However, this implementation could not meet the advanced security, manageability, or compliance requirements of the industry.

In the modern architecture, a software-defined community cloud is designed to deliver the required benefits. Google Cloud is a software-defined approach that provides security and compliance assurances without the strict physical infrastructure constraints of legacy approaches. The Google community clouds use a combination of technologies referred to as “assured clouds” that can:

- Define communities around common projects, security and compliance requirements, and policy.
- Separate shared community projects from other projects.
- Modify capabilities of a community’s boundary based on policy-controlled and audited configuration changes.
## **Comparison between traditional and software-defined community cloud**

The software-defined community cloud provides many benefits to the users in comparison to the traditional community cloud implementation. The following table depicts the comparison between the two implementations based on the characteristics as stated in the definition given by NIST.

|**Characteristic**|**NIST Definition SP 800-145**|**Traditional Cloud Community Implementation**|**Software-Defined Community Cloud**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Infrastructure Exclusivity**|The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns|Separate data centers with separate infrastructure|Each project is effectively a private cloud with isolated infrastructure primitives|
|**All users subject to common security controls**|(implied)|Same security controls apply across exclusive infrastructure shared by the community|Assured Workloads controls are scoped to the community and enforced through terms of service|
|**Personhood and citizenship of support staff**|It may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some combination of them,|Personnel must be physically located at dedicated facilities|Access management service restricts support to personnel with required attributes (personhood, citizenship, work location, and more)|
|**Data localization**|and it may exist on or off premises|Community dedicated storage devices|Enforced by software|
|**Defined security parameter**|(implied)|The community is the enclave|Each project is its own enclave|

## **Software defined community cloud as a new type of “Government Cloud”**

In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), a project is a unique, logical grouping of “infrastructure primitives.” In this context, an infrastructure primitive is any atomic unit of capacity in GCP – a virtual machine (VM), a persistent disk (PD), a storage bucket, and others. Projects are “global resources” that can be assigned infrastructure primitives from any region or zone.

Every project is an individual project separate from other customers’ projects. Low-level resources like hypervisors, blocks in our distributed blockstore that underlies Google Cloud Storage (GCS), and other components are isolated with resource abstractions that enforce the isolation both logically and cryptographically. 

A Private Cloud deployment model is defined in NIST SP 800-145 as:

Cloud infrastructure that is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers (such as business units). It may be owned, managed, and operated by the organization, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.

When a project is created within GCP, the infrastructure primitives that are assigned to that project are scoped to only that project. This scoping of infrastructure primitives effectively creates an “enclave” per Project.

When overlaid with Assured Workloads constraints for data residency, support personnel attributes, and security controls common to that community, these per-project private cloud enclaves become software-defined community clouds.
## **Benefits of a software-defined community cloud**

The approach Google Cloud has taken brings multiple benefits such as meeting security and compliance requirements. New hardware, new services, and improvements to existing services are accessed faster than in traditional community clouds. The process by which new cloud technology can be onboarded and made available is also faster. Overall efficiency is improved in this model due to the scale of infrastructure available to the community; this can translate to improved availability and performance. Security enhancements can be scaled and implemented more quickly.

# Cloud Infrastructure

- Cloud infrastructure consists of data centers, storage, networking components, and computing resources.
- Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based version of physical resources, made possible by hypervisors. 
- A few different types of Virtual Machines can be provisioned on the cloud. These include:
    - Shared or Public Cloud VMs that are provider-managed, multi-tenant deployments that can be provisioned on-demand with predefined sizes
    - Transient or Spot VMs that take advantage of unused capacity in a cloud data center
    - Reserved VMs that allow you to reserve capacity and guarantee resources for future deployments 
    - Dedicated hosts that offer single-tenant isolation
- Bare metal servers are single-tenant physical servers that are dedicated to a single customer. Bare metal servers fulfill the demanding needs of high-performance computing (HPC) and data-intense applications. They are ideal for applications that have a high degree of security or compliance requirements.
- Networking capabilities in the cloud are delivered as a service rather than in the form of rack-mounted devices. Cloud resources such as VMs (or VSIs), storage, network connectivity, and load balancers are deployed into subnets within Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). Using private and public subnets allows users to deploy multi-tier enterprise applications securely. Load balancers distribute the traffic and allow applications to be responsive.
- Containers are executable units of software in which application code, its libraries, and its dependences are packaged in a common way, so that it can be run anywhere, from desktops, traditional IT, to the cloud. Containers are more lightweight and consume fewer resources than Virtual Machines, helping streamline the development and deployment of cloud native applications.

# Cloud Storage and Content Delivery Networks

- Cloud storage is available in four main types–Direct Attached, File, Block, and Object Storage. These storage types differ in how they can be accessed, the capacity they offer, how much they cost, the types of data they are best suited to store, and their read-write speed.
- Direct Attached (or Local) Storage is storage that is presented directly to a cloud-based server and is effectively either within the host server chassis or within the same rack.
- File Storage is typically presented to compute nodes as a Network File System (NFS), which means that the storage is connected to compute nodes over a standard ethernet network.
- Block Storage is presented to compute nodes using high-speed fiber connections, typically provisioned in volumes, which are mounted onto a compute node. 
- Object Storage is accessed via an API and doesn’t need an underlying compute node.
- Object Storage offers infinite capacity as you can keep adding files to it and just pay for what you use. Compared to the other storage types, object storage is slowest in terms of read and write speeds.
- A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed server network that accelerates internet content delivery by delivering temporarily stored or cached copies of website or media content to users based on their geographic location.

# Hybrid Multi-Cloud, Microservices, and Serverless

- Hybrid multi-cloud is a cloud adoption strategy that makes it possible for public clouds, private clouds, and on-premises IT to interoperate seamlessly while leveraging the best cloud-based services from different public cloud providers.
- Microservices architecture is an approach in which an application is built as a collection of loosely coupled and independently deployable components or services, leading to efficient development, maintenance, and upgradation cycles.
- Serverless computing is an approach to computing that offloads responsibility for common infrastructure management tasks for application runtimes to cloud providers, allowing developers to focus their time and effort on development and testing, and not have to worry about provisioning, maintaining and scaling compute resources.
# DevOps on the Cloud

## **Harnessing the Power of DevOps on Cloud Platforms**

### **Introduction:**

Organizations strive to deliver software solutions swiftly, reliably, and efficiently in our ever-evolving digital landscape. DevOps, a collaborative approach that unifies software development and operations, has emerged as a significant change.
