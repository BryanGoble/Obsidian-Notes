# Introduction to Cloud Computing

- Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing resources over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis; resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned among multiple users and scale up and down in response to users’ needs.
- The origins of cloud computing can be traced back to the mainframes of the 1950s, with virtualization technologies and hypervisors serving as catalysts for the emergence of modern-day cloud computing.
- Organizations must consider their business needs, investment viability, and risk capacity to create a cloud adoption strategy that delivers desired benefits without causing business disruptions and security, compliance, or performance issues.
- Cloud adoption is growing faster than predicted. Driving this technological wave are cloud service providers with a host of services ranging from Infrastructure, Platform, and Software services. Some major Cloud providers of our time include AWS, Alibaba Cloud, Google, IBM, and Microsoft Azure.
## Business Case for Cloud Computing

- The adoption of cloud technologies enables enterprises, big and small, to be agile, innovative, and competitive and to create differentiated customer experiences. Organizations are asking not whether they should move to the cloud but rather what strategy they should adopt to move to the cloud.
- Some case studies that demonstrate the impact businesses have created by adopting the cloud:
    - American Airlines adopting cloud technologies to deliver customer value rapidly across its enterprise
    - UBank leveraging cloud platform services to give more control to their developers, thereby removing barriers to innovation
    - Bitly leveraging the scalability offered by cloud infrastructure for low-latency delivery to its geographically dispersed enterprise customers
    - ActivTrades leveraging the infrastructure, storage, network, and security offerings on the cloud to accelerate execution and delivery of new functions in their online trading systems to their customers
## Emerging Technologies Accelerated by Cloud

Emerging technologies powered by the cloud are disrupting existing business models and creating unprecedented opportunities for businesses to grow, innovate, and create value for their customers.

Some case studies that demonstrate how the use of emerging technologies on the cloud is creating value for millions around the world:
- The use of the Internet of Things on the cloud to combat poaching of endangered rhinos in South Africa
	- Provides the resources to store and process the data produced by IoT devices and users
- Artificial Intelligence on the cloud is being leveraged to deliver unique digital experiences to millions of fans around the world by the United States Tennis Association 
- Blockchain on the cloud helps farmers reduce waste by building traceability and transparency in the food supply chain
	- Blockchain provides a decentralized source of truth, AI powers analytics and decision-making, and the cloud provides globally distributed computing resources
- The use of data analytics for driving predictive maintenance solutions for a city’s infrastructure by KONE
