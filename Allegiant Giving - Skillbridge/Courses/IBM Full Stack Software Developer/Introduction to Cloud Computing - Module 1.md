# Introduction to Cloud Computing

- Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing resources over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis; resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned among multiple users and scale up and down in response to users’ needs.
- The origins of cloud computing can be traced back to the mainframes of the 1950s, with virtualization technologies and hypervisors serving as catalysts for the emergence of modern-day cloud computing.
- Organizations must consider their business needs, investment viability, and risk capacity to create a cloud adoption strategy that delivers desired benefits without causing business disruptions and security, compliance, or performance issues.
- Cloud adoption is growing faster than predicted. Driving this technological wave are cloud service providers with a host of services ranging from Infrastructure, Platform, and Software services. Some major Cloud providers of our time include AWS, Alibaba Cloud, Google, IBM, and Microsoft Azure.
## Business Case for Cloud Computing

- The adoption of cloud technologies enables enterprises, big and small, to be agile, innovative, and competitive and to create differentiated customer experiences. Organizations are asking not whether they should move to the cloud but rather what strategy they should adopt to move to the cloud.
- Some case studies that demonstrate the impact businesses have created by adopting the cloud:
    - American Airlines adopting cloud technologies to deliver customer value rapidly across its enterprise
    - UBank leveraging cloud platform services to give more control to their developers, thereby removing barriers to innovation

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
is a form of cloud computing that delivers fundamental:
- compute
- network
- storage
to consumers on-demand, over the internet, on a pay-as-you-go basis.

The cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components traditionally present in an on-premises data center as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer.

Offers customers the ability to track and monitor the performance and usage of their cloud services and manage disaster recovery.

Object storage is the most common mode of storage in the cloud, given that it is highly distributed and resilient.

# Deployment Models

- Deployment models indicate where the infrastructure resides, who owns and manages it, and how cloud resources and services are made available to users. There are four main deployment models available on the cloud—public, private, hybrid, and community.
- In the public cloud model, the service provider owns, manages, provisions, and maintains the physical infrastructure such as data centers, servers, networking equipment, and storage, with users accessing virtualized computing, networking and storage resources as services.
- In the private cloud model, the provider provisions the cloud infrastructure for exclusive use by a single organization. The private cloud infrastructure can be internal to the organization and run or on-premises. Or it can be on a public cloud, as in the case of Virtual Private Clouds (VPC), and be owned, managed, and operated by the cloud provider.
- In the hybrid cloud model, an organization’s on-premise private cloud and a third-party, public cloud are connected as a single, flexible infrastructure that leverages the features and benefits of both Public and Private clouds.
- In the community cloud model, the provider provisions the cloud infrastructure for use by a community of organizations with shared concerns. One or more of the organizations in the community, a third-party provider, or both are responsible for the ownership, management, and operation of this infrastructure.
# Community Cloud

A community cloud is defined by NIST SP 800-145 as:

“Cloud infrastructure [that] is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.”

## **Why community cloud?**

Community cloud approach is used by organizations for the following reasons:

- The community cloud members work under the same set of security controls.
- The approach provides the members the same attributes like citizenship and authorization controls while giving limited physical and/or logical access to resources.
- It also supports data localization and some data sovereignty requirements based on the location of the community cloud’s data centers. 
- The approach defines a perimeter security model encompassing the community cloud. 
## **Implementation of software-defined community cloud** 

To establish a security perimeter, most legacy community clouds depend on physical separation from other clouds. However, this implementation could not meet the advanced security, manageability, or compliance requirements of the industry.

In the modern architecture, a software-defined community cloud is designed to deliver the required benefits. Google Cloud is a software-defined approach that provides security and compliance assurances without the strict physical infrastructure constraints of legacy approaches. The Google community clouds use a combination of technologies referred to as “assured clouds” that can:

- Define communities around common projects, security and compliance requirements, and policy.
- Separate shared community projects from other projects.
- Modify capabilities of a community’s boundary based on policy-controlled and audited configuration changes.
## **Comparison between traditional and software-defined community cloud**

The software-defined community cloud provides many benefits to the users in comparison to the traditional community cloud implementation. The following table depicts the comparison between the two implementations based on the characteristics as stated in the definition given by NIST.

|**Characteristic**|**NIST Definition SP 800-145**|**Traditional Cloud Community Implementation**|**Software-Defined Community Cloud**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Infrastructure Exclusivity**|The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns|Separate data centers with separate infrastructure|Each project is effectively a private cloud with isolated infrastructure primitives|
|**All users subject to common security controls**|(implied)|Same security controls apply across exclusive infrastructure shared by the community|Assured Workloads controls are scoped to the community and enforced through terms of service|
|**Personhood and citizenship of support staff**|It may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some combination of them,|Personnel must be physically located at dedicated facilities|Access management service restricts support to personnel with required attributes (personhood, citizenship, work location, and more)|
|**Data localization**|and it may exist on or off premises|Community dedicated storage devices|Enforced by software|
|**Defined security parameter**|(implied)|The community is the enclave|Each project is its own enclave|

## **Software defined community cloud as a new type of “Government Cloud”**

In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), a project is a unique, logical grouping of “infrastructure primitives.” In this context, an infrastructure primitive is any atomic unit of capacity in GCP – a virtual machine (VM), a persistent disk (PD), a storage bucket, and others. Projects are “global resources” that can be assigned infrastructure primitives from any region or zone.

Every project is an individual project separate from other customers’ projects. Low-level resources like hypervisors, blocks in our distributed blockstore that underlies Google Cloud Storage (GCS), and other components are isolated with resource abstractions that enforce the isolation both logically and cryptographically. 

A Private Cloud deployment model is defined in NIST SP 800-145 as:

Cloud infrastructure that is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers (such as business units). It may be owned, managed, and operated by the organization, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.

When a project is created within GCP, the infrastructure primitives that are assigned to that project are scoped to only that project. This scoping of infrastructure primitives effectively creates an “enclave” per Project.

When overlaid with Assured Workloads constraints for data residency, support personnel attributes, and security controls common to that community, these per-project private cloud enclaves become software-defined community clouds.
## **Benefits of a software-defined community cloud**

The approach Google Cloud has taken brings multiple benefits such as meeting security and compliance requirements. New hardware, new services, and improvements to existing services are accessed faster than in traditional community clouds. The process by which new cloud technology can be onboarded and made available is also faster. Overall efficiency is improved in this model due to the scale of infrastructure available to the community; this can translate to improved availability and performance. Security enhancements can be scaled and implemented more quickly.

# Cloud Infrastructure

- Cloud infrastructure consists of data centers, storage, networking components, and computing resources.
- Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based version of physical resources, made possible by hypervisors. 
- A few different types of Virtual Machines can be provisioned on the cloud. These include:
    - Shared or Public Cloud VMs that are provider-managed, multi-tenant deployments that can be provisioned on-demand with predefined sizes
    - Transient or Spot VMs that take advantage of unused capacity in a cloud data center
    - Reserved VMs that allow you to reserve capacity and guarantee resources for future deployments 
    - Dedicated hosts that offer single-tenant isolation
- Bare metal servers are single-tenant physical servers that are dedicated to a single customer. Bare metal servers fulfill the demanding needs of high-performance computing (HPC) and data-intense applications. They are ideal for applications that have a high degree of security or compliance requirements.
- Networking capabilities in the cloud are delivered as a service rather than in the form of rack-mounted devices. Cloud resources such as VMs (or VSIs), storage, network connectivity, and load balancers are deployed into subnets within Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). Using private and public subnets allows users to deploy multi-tier enterprise applications securely. Load balancers distribute the traffic and allow applications to be responsive.
- Containers are executable units of software in which application code, its libraries, and its dependences are packaged in a common way, so that it can be run anywhere, from desktops, traditional IT, to the cloud. Containers are more lightweight and consume fewer resources than Virtual Machines, helping streamline the development and deployment of cloud native applications.

# Cloud Storage and Content Delivery Networks

- Cloud storage is available in four main types–Direct Attached, File, Block, and Object Storage. These storage types differ in how they can be accessed, the capacity they offer, how much they cost, the types of data they are best suited to store, and their read-write speed.
- Direct Attached (or Local) Storage is storage that is presented directly to a cloud-based server and is effectively either within the host server chassis or within the same rack.
- File Storage is typically presented to compute nodes as a Network File System (NFS), which means that the storage is connected to compute nodes over a standard ethernet network.
- Block Storage is presented to compute nodes using high-speed fiber connections, typically provisioned in volumes, which are mounted onto a compute node. 
- Object Storage is accessed via an API and doesn’t need an underlying compute node.
- Object Storage offers infinite capacity as you can keep adding files to it and just pay for what you use. Compared to the other storage types, object storage is slowest in terms of read and write speeds.
- A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed server network that accelerates internet content delivery by delivering temporarily stored or cached copies of website or media content to users based on their geographic location.

# Hybrid Multi-Cloud, Microservices, and Serverless

- Hybrid multi-cloud is a cloud adoption strategy that makes it possible for public clouds, private clouds, and on-premises IT to interoperate seamlessly while leveraging the best cloud-based services from different public cloud providers.
- Microservices architecture is an approach in which an application is built as a collection of loosely coupled and independently deployable components or services, leading to efficient development, maintenance, and upgradation cycles.
- Serverless computing is an approach to computing that offloads responsibility for common infrastructure management tasks for application runtimes to cloud providers, allowing developers to focus their time and effort on development and testing, and not have to worry about provisioning, maintaining and scaling compute resources.
# DevOps on the Cloud

## **Harnessing the Power of DevOps on Cloud Platforms**

### **Introduction:**

Organizations strive to deliver software solutions swiftly, reliably, and efficiently in our ever-evolving digital landscape. DevOps, a collaborative approach that unifies software development and operations, has emerged as a significant change. This topic will explain the essence of DevOps, explore its benefits when applied to cloud platforms, and provide real-world use cases that demonstrate its transformative capabilities on popular cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, GCP, and IBM Cloud.

### **What is DevOps?**

DevOps is an approach that fosters collaboration between development and operations teams, streamlining the entire software delivery lifecycle. By promoting a culture of collaboration, automation, and continuous feedback, DevOps enables organizations to deliver software products more efficiently and reliably.

## **The DevOps Process:**

To better understand the DevOps process, let's explore its key components:

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Developers integrate their code changes into a shared repository frequently, ensuring early detection of integration issues. Version control systems like Git and Subversion support this process.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Continuous delivery ensures that code changes are always in a state that can be released immediately. This state allows organizations to deploy software anytime with minimal manual intervention. Tools like Jenkins and Bamboo facilitate the automation of build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Continuous Deployment (CDep):** Continuous deployment takes automation further, enabling organizations to automatically deploy software changes into production environments after passing the necessary tests.
- **Continuous Monitoring (CM):** Continuous monitoring provides real-time insights into application and infrastructure performance, allowing organizations to detect issues promptly and take proactive measures. Tools like Prometheus and ELK Stack are commonly used for monitoring in DevOps.
## **Benefits of DevOps on Cloud Platforms:**

Implementing DevOps practices on cloud platforms offers several significant advantages:

- **Scalability and Flexibility:** Cloud platforms provide the scalability and flexibility required for DevOps workflows. Organizations can leverage cloud resources to scale infrastructure dynamically, accommodate varying workloads, and optimize resource utilization based on demand.
- **Rapid Provisioning and Deployment:** DevOps on the cloud facilitates rapid provisioning and deployment of infrastructure and applications. Cloud services offer pre-configured environments, automated provisioning, and deployment pipelines, enabling faster time-to-market and reducing manual effort.
- **Cost Optimization:** Cloud-based DevOps enables cost optimization by leveraging the pay-as-you-go model. Organizations can scale resources up or down based on demand, eliminating the need for upfront infrastructure investments, and reducing operational costs.
- **Collaboration and Team Efficiency:** DevOps practices on the cloud foster collaboration and enhance team efficiency. Cloud platforms provide centralized repositories, version control systems, and collaboration tools that facilitate seamless communication and shared code repositories, enabling effective collaboration across teams.
- **Continuous Integration and Delivery:** Cloud services seamlessly integrate with popular DevOps tools, enabling continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). This automation streamlines build, test, and deployment processes, reducing errors and facilitating faster, more reliable software releases.
## **DevOps Use Cases on Cloud Platforms**

Let's explore real-world use cases that highlight the benefits of DevOps on different cloud platforms:

- **DevOps on Amazon Web Services (AWS):** Organizations leveraging DevOps on AWS can take advantage of services such as AWS CodePipeline for CI/CD pipelines, AWS Elastic Beanstalk for simplified application deployment, and AWS Lambda for serverless computing. This use case enables seamless scalability, efficient resource management, and rapid delivery of software solutions.
- **DevOps on Microsoft Azure:** DevOps on Azure empowers organizations with services like Azure DevOps for collaboration, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for container orchestration, and Azure Functions for serverless computing. Organizations can achieve automated deployments, efficient scaling, and improved application performance by leveraging these services.
- **DevOps on Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** DevOps on GCP offers services such as Cloud Build for CI/CD pipelines, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for container management, and Cloud Functions for serverless computing. This use case enables organizations to automate infrastructure provisioning, manage complex containerized applications effectively and optimize resource utilization.
- **DevOps on IBM Cloud:** DevOps on IBM Cloud provides services like IBM Continuous Delivery for automated deployments, IBM Kubernetes Service (IKS) for container orchestration, and IBM Functions for serverless computing. These use cases allow organizations to achieve streamlined software delivery, efficient infrastructure management, and seamless scaling on the IBM Cloud platform.

# Policies and Principles of Access Management

# Policies

A policy in cloud security refers to a set of rules and guidelines that determine how users should access and protect resources within a cloud environment. These policies provide a framework for maintaining security, ensuring compliance with industry regulations, and mitigating potential risks.

The format of a policy typically includes the following:

- A title that provides a descriptive name or identifier for the policy
- The scope of the policy, which defines the specific resources, systems, or individuals to which the policy applies
- The objective of the policy, or its goals and purpose
- A policy statement that lists the rules, procedures, and restrictions of the policy
- The roles and responsibilities of the individuals and groups that are enforcing and adhering to the policy
- Compliance and enforcement details or the measures taken to monitor and ensure policy compliance
- A review and revision section which outlines how often to review and update the policy to remain relevant and effective
# Service provider and customer-managed policies

Cloud service providers (CSPs) typically have security policies that govern the overall security of their infrastructure, data centers, and services. These policies ensure a baseline level of security and protection for customer data. Service provider policies cover various aspects such as physical security, network security, data encryption, access controls, and incident response.

In addition to service provider policies, customers can implement their own policies, also known as customer-managed policies. These policies allow customers to tailor security measures according to their requirements, industry regulations, and risk tolerance. Customer-managed policies can include additional security controls, access restrictions, data protection measures, and compliance frameworks.

By combining service provider and customer-managed policies, organizations can establish a comprehensive security framework that aligns with their unique needs while benefiting from the underlying security measures provided by the cloud service provider.

# Principle of Least Privilege

The principle of least privilege is a key concept in access control that minimizes the risk of unauthorized access or accidental misuse of resources. It dictates that organizations should grant users only the minimum necessary permissions required to perform their tasks. By following the principle of least privilege, organizations limit the potential damage caused by compromised user accounts.
# User Access Level

In a cloud environment, user access levels vary depending on their roles and responsibilities. Some users may only need access to the console, or the graphical user interface (GUI) provided by the cloud service provider for resource management and configuration. These users interact with the cloud through the console to perform tasks such as provisioning resources, monitoring, and administration.

On the other hand, users involved in software development may require access to the development environment. This environment includes tools, APIs, and services necessary for building, testing, and deploying applications in the cloud. These users interact with the cloud infrastructure using APIs and command-line interfaces (CLIs) rather than relying solely on the console.

Depending on the organization’s requirements, certain users may have access to both the console and development environment, enabling them to perform a broader range of tasks and responsibilities.
# Identity and Access Management (IAM)

Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables organizations to manage and authenticate users’ identities and access to resources in a cloud environment. It involves the processes and policies that ensure that only authorized individuals have access privileges to sensitive systems, applications, and data. IAM simplifies user management by centralizing user provisioning, authentication, and authorization processes, making granting or revoking access rights easier as needed. This process helps organizations enhance security, protect sensitive information, enforce compliance with regulations, and streamline administrative tasks related to user access.
# Standard Password Policy

A standard password policy for users logging into the cloud should adhere to best practices to ensure strong password security. Typically, a password policy includes requirements for password complexity, such as a minimum length and a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The policy may also define password expiration intervals, after which users must change their passwords. Additionally, enforcing a password history, which is a required number of unique passwords used before reusing an old password, adds an extra layer of protection against password reuse. Other password policies may include account lockout, multi-factor authentication, and user awareness and training. The specific requirements of a password policy will depend on the organization’s needs, requirements, and risk assessments.
# Identity provider standards (SAML, OpenID)

Identity provider standards are protocols and frameworks that define how identity providers (IdPs) and service providers (SPs) securely exchange authentication and identity information. These standards ensure consistent and standardized approaches to authentication and access management. Two widely used identity provider standards are:

- Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) - SAML is an XML-based standard for exchanging authorization and authentication data between IdPs and SPs. It enables secure single sign-on (SSO) and identity federation. SAML allows users to authenticate once with their IdP and access multiple SPs without needing separate authentication. SAML assertions contain information about the user’s identity and attributes, which SPs rely on to grant access to their resources.
- OpenID Connect - OpenID Connect is a modern standard built on the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It provides a framework for authentication and identity federation. OpenID Connect allows users to authenticate using their chosen OpenID provider and obtain an ID token that contains information about their identity. Service providers can use the ID token to authenticate users and provide access to their resources.

These identity provider standards offer secure and interoperable solutions for managing authentication and access control in various contexts, including cloud environments, web applications, and enterprise systems. They enable organizations to establish trust relationships between identity providers and service providers, simplify user authentication experiences, and enhance security by centralizing identity management.
