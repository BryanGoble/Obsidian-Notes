# Overview of Git/GitHub

A Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) keeps track of changes to code, regardless of where it is stored. This allows multiple users to work on the same codebase or repository, mirroring the codebase on their own computers if needed, while the distributed version control software helps manage synchronization amongst the various codebase mirrors.

Repositories are storage structures that:

- Store the code 
- Track issues and changes
- Enable you to collaborate with others

Git is one of the most popular distributed version control systems. GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket are examples of hosted version control systems.

Branches are used to isolate changes to code. When the changes are complete, they can be merged back into the main branch.  

Repositories can be cloned to make it possible to work locally, then sync changes back to the original.

Repositories can be forked to be used as a base for a new project, or so that the developer can work independently.

A Pull Request (PR) can be submitted to have your changes reviewed and merged.

Large projects include people working in different roles:
- Developer – creates code
- Integrator – manages changes made by developers
- Repository Administrator – configures and maintains access to the repository

`git pull upstream` - used to fetch and merge the remote branch in a single step, but merged results aren't always desired
