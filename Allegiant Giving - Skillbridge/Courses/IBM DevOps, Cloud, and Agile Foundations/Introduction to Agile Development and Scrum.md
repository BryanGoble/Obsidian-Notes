	1. [Introduction to Agile Development and Scrum](https://www.coursera.org/learn/agile-development-and-scrum/)

- Agile is an iterative approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, interactivity, and transparency using small, cross-functional teams
- The Agile Manifesto describes the core values of Agile:
	- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
	- Working software over comprehensive documentation
	- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
	- Responding to change over following a plan
- The waterfall approach is a structured, step-by-step process that can lead to problems not surfaced until later in development
- Extreme Programming (XP) advocated an iterative approach that valued simplicity, communication, feedback, respect, and courage
- A Kanban system is characterized by visualizing workflow, limiting work in progress, managing and enhancing flow, making process policies explicit, and continuously improving a process
- Working in small batches means delivering something useful quickly
- An MVP is the cheapest/easiest thing you can do to test a hypothesis and learn
- Behavior Driven Development makes sure you are building the right thing
- Test Driven Development makes sure you are building the thing right
- Pair programming enables you to discover defects earlier and increase your code quality
- The Gherkin syntax, which comes from a company called Cucumber, is a single syntax that developers and stakeholders can understand: given some set of preconditions, when an event occurs, then some outcome is observed.

- Scrum is a methodology that follows the Agile philosophy
- The Scrum management framework:
	- Provides structure through defined roles, meetings, rules, and artifacts
	- Prescribes small, cross-functional, self-organizing teams
	- Uses fixed-length iterations called sprints
	- Produces a potentially shippable product increment with every iteration
- The product owner represents stakeholders, articulates the product vision, and decides priorities, requirements, and readiness to ship
- The scrum master coaches the team, promotes a cooperative environment, shields the team from interference, and unblocks impediments
- The scrum team is small, dedicated, co-located, cross-functional, and self-managing
- The scrum team negotiates commitments with the product owner — one sprint at a time
- The scrum team has autonomy regarding how to reach commitments
- Scrum produces a product backlog, a sprint backlog, and a completed — or done — increment
- The Scrum events are sprint planning, daily Scrum meetings, sprints, sprint reviews, and sprint retrospectives
If done well, Scrum can:
- Increase employee productivity and happiness
- Improve product quality
- Reduce time to market
- Enhance stakeholder satisfaction

- How you are organized can affect the systems that you build.
- Giving teams autonomy leads to motivated teams who can execute faster and build better systems
- Not adopting Agile across your organization can lead to operational bottlenecks
- Many companies adhere to their waterfall planning and call it Agile
- Simply doing iterative development is not Agile unless you are being responsive to changes and delivering value often

- Planning everything at the beginning of a project can lead to missed deadlines
- Iterative planning allows for course corrections and more accurate estimates
- Placing existing people in new roles without the proper training will lead to failure because Agile roles need a different focus and new priorities
- To be successful, the Agile mindset must be adopted by user management
- A kanban board is a way of tracking plan items needing to be done, items in process, and completed items
- A kanban board is made of multiple pipelines
- Work moves from left to right on the kanban board as it is completed

- A user story documents a person requesting a function to achieve a goal.
- Using a template helps ensure that stories are complete. 
- Defining "done" helps minimize misunderstandings. 
- Use the INVEST acronym to remember the qualities of a good user story: independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable. 
- Epics can be used to capture big ideas. 
- Story points are a metric used to estimate the difficulty of implementing a given user story.
- Story points are relative, like T-Shirt sizes. 
- You must agree on what "average" means. 
- You should never equate story points with wall-clock time. 
- A product backlog is a ranked list of all unimplemented stories. 
- Stories high in the ranking should have more detail than those that are lower. 
- Create stories using the "As a", "I need", "So that" template to ensure everyone understands who it benefits and the business value it provides.

- It is the product owner's responsibility to maintain a groomed backlog 
- Backlog refinement is used to order the product backlog and make stories sprint ready 
- You start refinement by triaging new issues 
- Large stories should be broken down until they are small enough to fit in a sprint 
- The goal of backlog refinement is to get the backlog ready for the sprint planning meeting 
- It is the product owner's responsibility to present the sprint goal 
- It is the development team’s responsibility to create a sprint plan 
- A sprint plan is created by moving stories from the product backlog into the sprint backlog until the team's velocity is reached

- You need to keep the kanban board updated so that everyone knows what you are working on
- It is important to always work on the story with the highest priority that you have skills for
- Working on more than one story at a time may lead to neither story being finished at the end of the sprint
- The daily stand-up occurs every day for 15 minutes
- Topics not related to the stand-up should be addressed after the meeting
- Each person should be prepared to answer the three stand-up questions:
	- What did I accomplish the previous day?
	- What will I work on today?
	- What blockers or impediments are in my way?

- A burndown chart shows the measurement of story points completed vs story points remaining for a sprint
- Burndown charts can be used to show progress and forecast the team's probability of achieving the sprint goal
- A sprint review is a demonstration of the features that have been implemented during the sprint
- Feedback from stakeholders is critical to help shape the future of the product
- The backlog is updated based on feedback
- A sprint retrospective is a time to reflect on how the sprint went
- The sprint retrospective is attended by the scrum master and the development team
- The team must feel comfortable to speak freely
- A sprint retrospective must result in changes to improve the next sprint
- Three questions are answered on what went right or wrong:
	- What went well? (keep doing)
	- What did not go well? (stop doing)
	- What should we change for the next sprint?

- High performing teams use metrics to continually improve 
- It is important to be sure that the metrics you use are actionable 
- You should take a baseline before trying to measure change.
- It is important to give developers credit for unfinished stories 
- Unfinished stories should be split into new stories to complete the work in the next sprint 
- Each sprint milestone should be closed when completed to reflect the velocity of the sprint 
- You should create a new milestone for the next sprint
- The top 4 actionable metrics can be used to improve your team’s overall performance
	- Mean Lead Time (How long does it take from idea to production?) 
	- Release Frequency (How often can you deliver changes?) 
	- Change Failure Rate (How often do changes fail?) 
	- Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) (How quickly can you recover from failure?) 
- Anti-patterns to avoid when practicing Scrum include:
	- No real product owner
	- Teams are too large
	- Teams are not dedicated
	- Teams are too geographically distributed
	- Teams are siloed
	- Teams are not self-managing
- The Scrum health check provides guidelines for measuring a healthy scrum team
