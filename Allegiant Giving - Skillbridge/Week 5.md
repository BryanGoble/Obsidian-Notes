## Interpreted vs. Compiled Languages
**Interpreted Languages**:

1. **Execution**: Interpreted languages are executed line by line, directly by an interpreter software. The code is read and executed sequentially from top to bottom.

2. **Portability**: Code written in an interpreted language is generally more portable because it can run on any platform with the corresponding interpreter.

3. **Debugging**: Debugging is often easier in interpreted languages because errors can be caught and reported as soon as they occur in the code.

4. **Performance**: Interpreted languages tend to have slower execution speed compared to compiled languages because the code is translated and executed on the fly.

**Compiled Languages**:

1. **Compilation**: Compiled languages are first translated into machine code (or intermediate code) by a compiler before execution. This translation step creates a separate executable file.

2. **Execution**: The compiled program is executed directly by the computer's CPU, which can lead to faster execution times compared to interpreted languages.

3. **Portability**: Compiled programs are typically less portable because they are specific to the machine architecture and operating system for which they were compiled.

4. **Debugging**: Debugging in compiled languages can be more challenging since errors are detected during the compilation phase, which may require extra effort to identify and fix.

In summary, interpreted languages are easier to write, more portable, and offer better debugging capabilities but tend to be slower in terms of execution speed. Compiled languages produce faster-running programs but are less portable and can be more challenging to debug. The choice between them depends on the specific needs of a project and the trade-offs you are willing to make.

## Benefits of Automation
- Scalability - When more work is added to a system, the system can do whatever it needs to complete the work
- Centralizing Mistakes

## Pareto Principle
One fifth of the sysadmin tasks you perform comprise four fifths of your total workload.
