# Agile [^1]
- Iterate constantly
	- develop enough to have a minimum viable product
	- seek feedback and make changes
	- continue developing/ adapt as necessary
- Agile values:
	- **Individuals and interactions** over process and tools
	- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
	- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
	- **Responding to change** over following a plan
- Remain flexible enough to adapt to changing customers, challenges, and competition

- Best used when:
	- Require small updates
	- Get to the end product fast
## Sprints
- Specific timeframe set aside for developers/teams to meet minimum requirements
- Business stakeholder priorities are converted to *requirements*
	- These determine how long a task should take or when its completed and if it is dependent on something else
	- Requirements are minted into Tickets to be tracked for progress
- Once the first Sprint comes to a close, the plan for the next Sprint begins to either adjust timelines and/or discuss what went well or didn't. This is called Retrospective.
## Scrum Masters
- Person in charge of individual Sprints
- Not a manager, but focuses primarily on the teams themselves and are a mix between a Project Manager and Stake Holder Ambassador. They also don't necessarily have a tech background.
- Concerned with helping get the requirements completed, managing stress levels, and ensuring the teams have what they need.
## Stand Ups
- Meeting performed while standing up to get individuals focused and engaged.
- This is the time to hear what others are working on and put out what progress you have made yourself.
- You should also mention if you've gotten stuck or bogged down by something.

# Waterfall [^2]
- Incubating on an idea (focus on development)
	- Think about your idea/concept.
	- Plan your way forward
	- Then act
- Sequential Design Process
	1. Analysis
	2. Design
	3. Implement
	4. Testing
	5. Maintenance
- Bigger focus on testing and ensuring the product works from the get go

- Best used when:
	- Quality, Testing, Completeness > Speed
	- The product has to work from day one
